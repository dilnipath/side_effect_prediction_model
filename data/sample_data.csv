Alteplase,Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) used as a thrombolytic agent.[L43125] It cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin an enzyme involved in the degradation of fibrin clots. In the absence of fibrin the alteplase-mediated conversion of plasminogen is limited thanks to the high affinity between alteplase and fibrin.[A252330L43125] Alteplase is a purified glycoprotein of 527 amino acids expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.[A252345L43125] It was first approved by the FDA in 1987 for the management of thromboembolic disease including acute myocardial infarction (AMI).[A252270] The use of alteplase to manage AMI has decreased thanks to the availability of safer treatments such as angioplasty and stenting. However its use for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has increased over the years.[A252340] New thrombolytic agents derived from tissue plasminogen activator such as [desmoteplase] [tenecteplase] and [reteplase] have also been developed.[A252270A252345] Alteplase is also available as Cathflo Activase (intracatheter instillation) for the restoration of function to central venous access devices.[L34864],Toxicity information regarding alteplase is not readily available. Patients experiencing an overdose are at an increased risk of severe adverse effects such as risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events.[L43125] Symptomatic and supportive measures are recommended. The carcinogenic potential of alteplase or its effect on fertility have not been evaluated. _In vivo_ studies evaluating tumorigenicity and _in vitro_ studies evaluating mutagenicity were negative.[L43125] It has been estimated that the acute oral and dermal toxicity of alteplase is above 5000 mg/kg.[L43175],
Aldesleukin,Aldesleukin a lymphokine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a genetically engineered E. coli strain containing an analog of the human interleukin-2 gene. Genetic engineering techniques were used to modify the human IL-2 gene and the resulting expression clone encodes a modified human interleukin-2. This recombinant form differs from native interleukin-2 in the following ways: a) Aldesleukin is not glycosylated because it is derived from E. coli; b) the molecule has no N-terminal alanine; the codon for this amino acid was deleted during the genetic engineering procedure; c) the molecule has serine substituted for cysteine at amino acid position 125.,-1,
Adalimumab,Adalimumab is a subcutaneously administered biological disease modifier for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic debilitating diseases mediated by tumor necrosis factor.[A39984A39999] It was originally launched by Abbvie in the U.S. and approved in 2002 by the FDA.[A39983] This drug is frequently known as _Humira_. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a mammalian cell expression system. This drug is available in a prefilled syringe form and convenient pen form for subcutaneous self-administered doses.[A39983] Several biosimilars to adalimumab. Adalimumab-atto was the first adalimumab biosimilar approved by the FDA in 2016.[L44953] Adalimumab-adaz was approved by the FDA on October 31 2018.[L4799] Other biosimilars include adalimumab-fkjp - which was approved in July 2022 -[L42495] adalimumab-bwwd - which was approved in August 2022 -[L42935] adalimumab-aacf - which was approved in October 2023 [L49101] and adalimumab-ryvk  - which was approved in February 2024[L52088]. A biosimilar marketed as Hyrimoz a high-concentration formulation of adalimumab is also available.[L45643L45818]. A high-concentration citrate-free formulation of Cyltezo® (adalimumab-adbm) a biosimilar to Humira® was approved by the FDA in May 2024 for the treatment of multiple chronic inflammatory diseases.[L53083],Doses up to 10 mg/kg have been administered to patients in clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. In case of overdosage it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.[L42290],
Agalsidase beta,Agalsidase beta is a recombinant human α-galactosidase A similar to [agalsidase alfa]. While patients generally do not experience a clinically significant difference in outcomes between the two drugs some patients may experience greater benefit with agalsidase beta.[A220228A220233] Use of agalsidase beta has decreased in Europe in favor of agalsidase alfa after a contamination event in 2009.[A220343]Agalsidase beta was granted FDA approval on 24 April 2003.[L16383],Data regarding overdoses of agalsidase beta are not readily available.[L16383] Patients experiencing an overdose of agalsidase beta may experience an increased incidence and severity of adverse effects.[L16383] Overdose can be managed through the use of symptomatic and supportive measures.,
Amphetamine,Amphetamine a compound discovered over 100 years ago is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.[A18540] The first product of Smith Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.[L5194]During World War II amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.[A18540],The mean lethal serum concentration is reported to be of 6.4 mg/l. Acute amphetamine overdose can lead to hyperthermia respiratory depression seizures metabolic acidosis renal failure hepatic injury and coma. Some of the neurologic effects have been shown to be agitation aggressive behavior irritability headache and hallucinations. In the cardiovascular site there have been reports of arrhythmia cardiomyopathy myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. Lastly in the GI tract there are reports if abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea cramps anorexia and GI hemorrhage. A dose of 1-2 g of amphetamine is known to cause severe intoxication but some chronic abusers can report usage of even 5-15 g per day.[L5212]In animal studies there is no evidence of carcinogenic potential not clastogenic or to affect fertility or early embryonic development.[FDA label],CC(N)CC1=CC=CC=C1
Phentermine,Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic agent and it was introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug.[A174361 A174364] It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine.[A174370] Phentermine has not been reported an addictive potential which allows this agent to be classified under the Schedule IV drugs (low abuse potential).[A174367]Phentermine was FDA approved for short-term weight management in 1959 and it became widely used in 1960. This initial product formed by the combination of phentermine with [fenfluramine] and [dexfenfluramine] was discontinued after finding several reports of abnormal valves in nearly 30% of the consumers.[A174376 T403] Later on phentermine was approved alone and in combination with topiramate in 2012 as a new alternative that required lower doses of phentermine to obtain the desired effect.[A174373],The reported LD50 after oral administration of phentermine in rats is reported to be of 151 mg/kg.[L5239] Reports of acute overdose include restlessness tremors hyperreflexia rapid respiration confusion assaultiveness hallucinations and panic state followed by fatigue and depression. In the cardiovascular system there are reports of tachycardia arrhythmia hypertension hypotension circulatory collapse. In the GI tract there are symptoms of nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal cramps. The management of acute overdosage includes symptomatic treatment as well as lavage and sedation with barbiturates.[FDA label]On the other hand chronic overdosage is marked by dermatoses insomnia irritability hyperactivity and personality changes. In severe cases it can derive into a schizophrenia-like psychosis.[FDA label]Studies regarding the carcinogenic potential have not been performed. On the case of mutagenic assays phentermine was shown to not be mutagenic nor clastogenic.[FDA label],CC(C)(N)CC1=CC=CC=C1
Adapalene,Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial disorder of the pilosebaceous unit involving increased sebum production inflammation and hyperproliferation/hyperkeratinization of the follicular infundibulum. It is also associated with _Cutibacterium acnes_ (also known as _Propionibacterium acnes_). Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid used for the treatment of acne vulgaris.[A193518] Adapalene has similar efficacy but a superior safety profile compared to tretinoin.[A193521] [Tazarotene] is more efficacious than adapalene but is designated as pregnancy category X and hence is contraindicated in pregnant women.[A193518] Adapalene can also be combined with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) which possesses bactericidal properties[A193524] and either adapalene alone or adapalene BPO combination products are commonly used to treat mild-to-severe acne.[A193518]Differin® produced by Galderma Labs was first granted FDA approval on May 31st 1996 as a 0.1% adapalene topical solution. Differin was later made available as 0.1% gel cream or lotion or 0.3% gel products. On December 8th 2008 Galderma Labs gained FDA approval for Epiduo® a 0.1% adapalene 2.5% BPO combination gel.[L12873],Toxicity information regarding adapalene is not readily available. Patients experiencing an overdose are at an increased risk of severe adverse effects such as redness scaling and skin discomfort. Symptomatic and supportive measures are recommended.[L12873]Adapalene has an acute oral LD<sub>50</sub> in S-D rats and CD-1 mice of over 5000 mg/kg. The LD<sub>50</sub> of 0.3% applied topically to Credo OF1 mice is over 10 ml/kg (30 mg/kg). No systemic or local toxicity was observed in rats treated topically with 6 mg/kg/day of 0.3% adapalene.[L12897],-1
Dapsone,A sulfone active against a wide range of bacteria but mainly employed for its actions against mycobacterium leprae. Its mechanism of action is probably similar to that of the sulfonamides which involves inhibition of folic acid synthesis in susceptible organisms. It is also used with pyrimethamine in the treatment of malaria. (From Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia 30th ed p157-8),Overdosage might be expected to produce nasal congestion syncope or hallucinations. Measures to support blood pressure should be taken if necessary.,NC1=CC=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(N)C=C1
Doxycycline,Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic synthetically derived from [oxytetracycline].[L42880] It is a second-generation tetracycline that was first discovered in 1967.[A19429] Second-generation tetracyclines exhibit lesser toxicity than first-generation tetracyclines.[A174034] Doxycycline is used to treat a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is also used to treat acne and malaria.[A251730],Oral LD<sub>50</sub> is 2000 mg/kg in rats 1870 mg/kg in mice and 500 mg/kg in dog.[L42905]In case of overdosage doxycycline should be discontinued and symptomatic and supportive treatment should be initiated. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.[L42870],[H][C@@]12[C@@H](C)C3=CC=CC(O)=C3C(=O)C1=C(O)[C@]1(O)C(=O)C(C(N)=O)=C(O)[C@@H](N(C)C)[C@]1([H])[C@H]2O
Anagrelide,Anagrelide is a platelet-reducing agent used to lower dangerously elevated platelet levels (i.e. to treat thrombocythemia) in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.[L14153] It is an oral imidazoquinazoline that was first approved for use in the US in 1997.[A214274] It appears to carry a better response rate than other thrombocythemia treatments (e.g. [busulfan] [hydroxyurea]) and may be better tolerated.[A214274],The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of anagrelide as reported in rats and mice is >1500mg/kg and >2500mg/kg respectively.[L14243] Symptoms of overdose may include hypotension sinus tachycardia and vomiting. As the therapeutic effect of anagrelide (i.e. platelet reduction) is dose-related significant thrombocytopenia is expected in instances of overdose.[L14153] Treatment of overdose should involve careful monitoring of platelet counts and complications such as bleeding.[L14153] Employ symptomatic and supportive measures if clinically indicated.,ClC1=CC=C2N=C3NC(=O)CN3CC2=C1Cl
Theophylline,A methylxanthine derivative from tea with diuretic smooth muscle relaxant bronchial dilation cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities. Mechanistically theophylline acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor adenosine receptor blocker and histone deacetylase activator. Theophylline is marketed under several brand names such as Uniphyl and Theochron and it is indicated mainly for asthma bronchospasm and COPD.,Symptoms of overdose include seizures arrhythmias and GI effects.,CN1C2=C(NC=N2)C(=O)N(C)C1=O
Acarbose,Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that acts as an inhibitor of several enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the intestines. It inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - including intestinal glucoamylase sucrase maltase and isomaltase - which are responsible for the metabolism of complex starches and oligo- tri- and disaccharides into absorbable simple sugars.[L31633A37868] By inhibiting the activity of these enzymes acarbose limits the absorption of dietary carbohydrates and the subsequent postprandial increase in blood glucose and insulin levels. Acarbose is therefore used in conjunction with diet exercise and other pharmacotherapies for the management of blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.[L31628L31633]Acarbose is one of only two approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (the other being [miglitol]) receiving its first FDA approval in 1995 under the brand name Precose (since discontinued).[L31668] This class of antidiabetic therapy is not widely used due to their relatively modest impact on A1c their requirement for thrice-daily dosing and the potential for significant gastrointestinal adverse effects.[L31668],The symptoms of acarbose overdose are likely to be consistent with its adverse effect profile and may therefore include significant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (flatulence distension etc) although an overdose on an empty stomach (i.e. when not co-administered with food) is less likely to result in these GI symptoms.[L31628] In the event of an overdose patients should be instructed to avoid carbohydrate-containing foods for 4-6 hours following administration as these can precipitate the aforementioned GI symptoms.[L31628],[H]C(=O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@]([H])(O[C@@]1([H])O[C@H](CO)[C@@]([H])(O[C@H]2O[C@H](C)[C@@H](N[C@@]3([H])C=C(CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]3O)[C@H](O)[C@H]2O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O)[C@H](O)CO
Acetaminophen,Acetaminophen (paracetamol) also commonly known as _Tylenol_ is the most commonly taken analgesic worldwide and is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO).[A176318] It is also used for its antipyretic effects helping to reduce fever.[F4124] This drug was initially approved by the U.S. FDA in 1951 and is available in a variety of forms including syrup form regular tablets effervescent tablets injection suppository and other forms.[L5756L5774F4124]Acetaminophen is often found combined with other drugs in more than 600 over the counter (OTC) allergy medications cold medications sleep medications pain relievers and other products.[L5783] Confusion about dosing of this drug may be caused by the availability of different formulas strengths and dosage instructions for children of different ages.[L5783] Due to the possibility of fatal overdose and liver failure associated with the incorrect use of acetaminophen it is important to follow current and available national and manufacturer dosing guidelines while this drug is taken or prescribed.[L5786L5789L4396]On September 22 2025 the US FDA initiated a labeling change for acetaminophen products suggesting that the use of acetaminophen by pregnant women may be associated with an increased risk of neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD in children.[L53926] While the FDA updated labeling to caution about potential risks large studies[A274401A274406] national and international health authorities[L53941L53946L53951] and professional organizations - including the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC)[L53931] and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)[L53936]- maintain that acetaminophen use in pregnancy remains a first-line therapeutic option when used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest required duration.,-1,CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(O)C=C1
Metformin,-1,**Metformin (hydrochloride) toxicity data**: Oral LD50 (rat): 1 g/kg; Intraperitoneal LD50 (rat): 500 mg/kg; Subcutaneous LD50 (rat): 300 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (mouse): 1450 mg/kg; Intraperitoneal LD50 (mouse): 420 mg/kg; Subcutaneous LD50 (mouse): 225 mg/kg.[L40283L50211]**A note on lactic acidosis**Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate thereby increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.[L40243] There have been reported postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis including some fatal cases. Such cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms including malaise myalgias abdominal pain respiratory distress or increased somnolence. In certain cases hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe lactic acidosis.[L40243] Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L) anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia) as well as an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL.[L40243]Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate) age 65 years old or greater having a radiological study with contrast surgery and other procedures hypoxic states (e.g. acute congestive heart failure) excessive alcohol intake and hepatic impairment.[L40243]**A note on renal function**In patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased.[L40243]Metformin should be avoided in those with severely compromised renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) acute/decompensated heart failure severe liver disease and for 48 hours after the use of iodinated contrast dyes due to the risk of lactic acidosis.[L40243] Lower doses should be used in the elderly and those with decreased renal function. Metformin decreases fasting plasma glucose postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Metformin may also have a positive effect on lipid levels. **A note on hypoglycemia** When used alone metformin does not cause hypoglycemia however it may potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylureas and insulin when they are used together.[L40243]**Use in pregnancy** Available data from post-marketing studies have not indicated a clear association of metformin with major birth defects miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was ingested during pregnancy. Despite this the abovementioned studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk due to methodological limitations including small sample size and inconsistent study groups.[L40243]**Use in nursing**A limited number of published studies indicate that metformin is present in human milk. There is insufficient information to confirm the effects of metformin on the nursing infant and no available data on the effects of metformin on the production of milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered as well as the mother’s clinical need for metformin and any possible adverse effects on the nursing child.[L40243],CN(C)C(=N)NC(N)=N
Doxylamine,Histamine H1 antagonist with pronounced sedative properties. It is used in allergies and as an antitussive antiemetic and hypnotic. Doxylamine has also been administered in veterinary applications and was formerly used in parkinsonism.,Signs of overdose include wheezing tightness in the chest fever itching bad cough blue skin color fits swelling of face lips tongue or throat.,CN(C)CCOC(C)(C1=CC=CC=C1)C1=CC=CC=N1
Phenylephrine,Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat hypotension[L9416L9410] dilate the pupil[L9413] and induce local vasoconstriction.[A187370] The action of phenylephrine or neo-synephrine was first described in literature in the 1930s.[A187376]Phenylephrine was granted FDA approval in 1939.[L9413],Patients experiencing and overdose may present with headache hypertension reflex bradycardia tingling limbs cardiac arrhythmias and a feeling of fullness in the head.[L9416L9413L9410] Overdose may be treated by supportive care and discontinuing phenylephrine chronotropic medications and vasodilators.[A187370] Subcutaneous phentolamine may be used to treat tissue extravasation.[A187370L9413],CNC[C@H](O)C1=CC(O)=CC=C1
Spironolactone,Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It binds to mineralocorticoid receptors and functions as aldosterone antagonists.[A178192] It promotes sodium and water excretion and potassium retention.[A11837] Spironolactone was originally developed purely for this ability before other pharmacodynamic properties of the drug were discovered.[A11837 A178246] It is indicated to treat several conditions including heart failure edema hyperaldosteronism and hypertension.[L44602] Off-label uses of spironolactone include hirsutism female pattern hair loss and adult acne vulgaris.[A178135 A261025] Spironolactone was developed in 1957 marketed in 1959 and approved by the FDA on January 21 1960.[A178243],-1,[H][C@@]12CC[C@@]3(CCC(=O)O3)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])[C@@]([H])(CC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C)SC(C)=O
Methylphenidate,Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant used most commonly in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and for narcolepsy. Also known as the marketed products Ritalin Concerta or Biphentin methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological educational cognitive behaviour therapy etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility short attention span hyperactivity emotional lability and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate [DB01576] and [DB01255] are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD and are considered first-line options for children adolescents and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). [L6037] CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies of over twenty years in duration which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.  While its exact mechanism is unclear methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action.[A177541] There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects.[A177547] The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement impulsivity and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.[A177541 A177544] Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.[A177550] Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4) and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate suggesting a possible mode of action.[F4474]When provided as Biphentin® methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school homework periods during the work day etc).When provided as Concerta® methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.[A631] OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment such as the stomach the drug overcoat which consists of 22% of the dose dissolves within one hour providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect allowing for once-daily dosing.Methylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A177553] In particular increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including [DB00289] and [DB01018].,Symptoms of overdose include vomiting agitation tremors hyperreflexia muscle twitching convulsions (may be followed by coma) euphoria confusion hallucinations delirium sweating flushing headache hyperpyrexia tachycardia palpitations cardiac arrhythmias hypertension mydriasis and dryness of mucous membranes.

Ketorolac,Ketorolac is a Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is commercially available as an oral tablet injectable nasal spray and as an ophthalmic solution.[L6358][L6508][L11055][L3674][L11070] It's analgesic properties make it a useful pain management tool across many settings including postoperative pain rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis menstrual disorders headaches spinal and soft tissue pain and ankylosing spondylitis.[L6520] Impressively ketorolac has a similar efficacy to standard doses of morphine and meperidine making it a useful opioid sparing agent.[L6511],The rate of adverse effects increases with higher doses of ketorolac. The most frequently observed adverse effects in patients occurring with an incidence of greater than 10% include: abdominal pain dyspepsia nausea and headaches.[L11055] Most adverse effects associated with short term use are mild in nature related to the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system and occur in roughly 39% of patients.[A176131] Common symptoms of ketorolac overdose include nausea vomiting epigastric pain gastrointestinal bleeding lethargy and drowsiness. More rare symptoms of overdose include acute renal failure hypertension respiratory depression and coma.[L3674]Ketorolac is classified as Pregnancy Category C since there is a lack of evidence demonstrating safety in pregnant women.[L11070] NSAIDs including ketorolac increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus in the 3rd trimester; therefore beginning at 30 weeks gestation pregnant women should avoid ketorolac.[L11070]Ketorolac has been shown to be excreted in breast milk and although available data has not demonstrated any adverse effects in nursing infants practitioners should proceed with caution when suggesting ketorolac for nursing mothers.[L11055L3674]  The benefits should outweigh the risks and the mother should be counselled to monitor the infant closely and to contact the infant's healthcare provider should any adverse effects arise.[L11055L3674]Women who are trying to conceive are not advised to take ketorolac since it's effect on prostaglandin synthesis may impair fertility.[L11055L11055],OC(=O)C1CCN2C1=CC=C2C(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1

Zafirlukast,Zafirlukast is an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) for the maintenance treatment of asthma often used in conjunction with an inhaled steroid and/or long-acting bronchodilator. It is available as a tablet and is usually dosed twice daily. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is montelukast (Singulair) which is usually taken just once daily.Zafirlukast blocks the action of the cysteinyl leukotrienes on the CysLT1 receptors thus reducing constriction of the airways build-up of mucus in the lungs and inflammation of the breathing passages.,Side effects include rash and upset stomach.,COC1=CC(=CC=C1CC1=CN(C)C2=C1C=C(NC(=O)OC1CCCC1)C=C2)C(=O)NS(=O)(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1C
Methotrexate,Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis.[A180322] This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division.[A180322] Because of these effects methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[A180322L7144L7147L7150L7180]Due to the toxic effects of methotrexate it is indicated for treatment of some forms of arthritis and severe psoriasis only if first line treatment has failed or patients are intolerant of those treatments.[L7180]Methotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.[L7198],The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 135mg/kg and in mice is 146mg/kg.[L7204]Symptoms of overdose include hematologic and gastrointestinal reactions like leukopenia thombocytopenia anemia pancytopenia bone marrow suppression mucositis stomatitis oral ulceration nausea vomiting gastrointestinal ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding.[L7180] In the event of an overdose patients should be treated with glucarpidase and not be given leucovorin for 2 hours before or after glucarpidase.[L7180],CN(CC1=CN=C2N=C(N)N=C(N)C2=N1)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O
Acamprosate,Alcohol use disorder is responsible for a large worldwide burden of morbidity premature mortality and economic consequences resulting from accidents violence incarceration decreased productivity and increased healthcare spending.[A229073]Acamprosate also known by the brand name Campral is a drug used for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence. It is a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).[L31758] Acamprosate is the first medication specifically formulated for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence in ethanol-dependent patients after alcohol detoxification[A997] unlike [naltrexone] and [disulfiram]. It was first approved by the FDA in 2004 and initially marketed by Forest Laboratories.[L31783],The intraperitoneal LD50 in male mice is 1.87 g/kg.[L31813]  In reported cases of acute overdosage with acamprosate (doses of up to 56 grams of acamprosate calcium) diarrhea was the only reported symptom attributable to acamprosate.

Tetracycline,Tetracycline is a broad spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of Actinobacteria. It exerts a bacteriostatic effect on bacteria by binding reversible to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking incoming aminoacyl tRNA from binding to the ribosome acceptor site. It also binds to some extent to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and may alter the cytoplasmic membrane causing intracellular components to leak from bacterial cells.The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all liquid oral drug products formulated for pediatric use containing tetracycline in a concentration greater than 25 mg/ml.[L43942] Other formulations of tetracycline continue to be used.,LD<sub>50</sub>=808mg/kg (orally in mice),[H][C@@]12C[C@@]3([H])C(=C(O)[C@]1(O)C(=O)C(C(N)=O)=C(O)[C@H]2N(C)C)C(=O)C1=C(O)C=CC=C1[C@@]3(C)O

Perindopril,Perindopril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to perindoprilat its active metabolite following oral administration. Perindoprilat is a potent competitive inhibitor of ACE the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Perindopril may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension mild to moderate congestive heart failure and to reduce the cardiovascular risk of individuals with hypertension or post-myocardial infarction and stable coronary disease.,The most likely symptom of overdose is severe hypotension. The most common adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trials include cough digestive symptoms fatigue headache and dizziness. ,[H][C@]12C[C@H](N(C(=O)[C@H](C)N[C@@H](CCC)C(=O)OCC)[C@@]1([H])CCCC2)C(O)=O
Fentanyl,Fentanyl a potent opioid agonist was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia.[A179542] Because of these characteristics fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia.[LabelL6598L6601L6604L6607L922L6610L6613] Fentanyl is related to other opioids like [morphine] and [oxycodone].Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs especially heroin.[A179542] In 2017 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths).[L6748] Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily.[L6751]Fentanyl was FDA approved in 1968.[LabelL6598L6601L6604L6607L922L6610L6613],Fentanyl has an intravenous LD<sub>50</sub> of 2.91mg/kg in rats[A1220] an oral LD<sub>50</sub> of 18mg/kg in rats and 368mg/kg in mice.[MSDS] The LD50 in humans is not known.Symptoms of overdose include respiratory depression somnolence stupor coma skeletal muscle flaccidity cold and clammy skin pupillary constriction pulmonary edema bradycardia hypotension airway obstruction atypical snoring and death.[LabelL6598L6601L6604L6607L922L6610] In case of overdose patients should receive naloxone or nalmefene to reverse the action of the opioids as well as supportive measures to maintain the airway or advanced life support in the case of cardiac arrest.[LabelL6598L6601L6604L6607L922L6610],-1
Acetazolamide,One of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that is sometimes effective against absence seizures. It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic myoclonic and atonic seizures particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient increased chloride current and increased inhibition.

Tadalafil,Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and benign prostatic hypertrophy.[L39100 L39105] It was first approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in ED and later in 2009 for PAH. In contrast to other PDE5 inhibitors like [sildenafil] tadalafil has greater selectivity for PDE5 and a longer half-life which has made it a more suitable option for chronic once-daily dosing in the treatment of PAH.[A242287],Symptoms of overdose are expected to be similar to typical adverse effects which may include headache dyspepsia back pain myalgia nasopharyngitis and dizziness.[L39095 L39100] Standard supportive care is recommended.

Pseudoephedrine,Pseudoephedrine is structurally related to [ephedrine] but exerts a weaker effect on the sympathetic nervous system.[A188820A188823] Both drugs naturally occur in in ephedra plant which have a history of use in traditional Eastern medicine and were first researched in the west in 1889.[A188823] The decongestant effect of pseudoephedrine was described in dogs in 1927.[A188823],The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of pseudoephedrine is 2206mg/kg in rats and 726mg/kg in mice.[L11040]Patients experiencing an overdose of pseudoephedrine may present with giddiness headache nausea vomiting sweating thirst tachycardia precordial pain palpitations difficulty urinating muscle weakness muscle tension anxiety restlessness insomnia toxic psychosis cardiac arrhythmias circulatory collapse convulsions coma and respiratory failure.[L11058L11061] Treat overdose with symptomatic and supportive treatment including removal of unabsorbed drug.[L11058L11061],-1
Prednisolone,Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid similar to [cortisol] used for its anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive anti-neoplastic and vasoconstrictive effects.[A187463]Prednisolone was granted FDA approval on 21 June 1955.[L9431],The intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 2g/kg and 65mg/kg in mice.[L9545] The subcutaneous LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 147mg/kg and >3500mg/kg in mice.[L9545] The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in mice is 1680mg/kg.[L9545] In humans the oral TDLO in men is 9mg/kg/2W and in women is 14mg/kg/13D.[L9545]Patients experiencing an overdose of prednisolone may present with gastrointestinal disturbances insomnia and restlessness.[A187511] Overdose of oral prednisolone may be treated by gastric lavage or inducing vomiting if the overdose was recent as well as supportive and symptomatic therapy.[L9449] Chronic overdosage may be treated by dose reduction or treating patients on alternate days.[L9449] An overdose by the ophthalmic route is not expected to cause problems.[L9449],-1
Guaifenesin,Guaifenesin possesses a storied history having been originally formally approved by the US FDA in 1952 and continues to be one of very few - if not perhaps the only drug that is readily available and used as an expectorant [F4525]. Since that time the agent has been a combination component of various prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter cough and cold products and is currently a widely available over-the-counter generic medication [F4525]. Although it is principally believed that guaifenesin elicits an action to facilitate productive cough to manage chest congestion [A177661 L6100 F4516 F4522 F4525] it is not known whether the agent can reliably mitigate coughing.Regardless on March 1 2007 the FDA received a petition asking the FDA to notify the public that some antitussives expectorants decongestants antihistamines and cough/cold combinations are not known to be safe and effective in children under the age of 6 years [F4525]. After the negotiation between FDA and major manufacturers a voluntary transition of labels for not using guaifenesin in children under the age of 4 years was endorsed by FDA in 2008 [F4525].Furthermore there has also been contemporary research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist [A177652].,The most prevalent signs and symptoms associated with an overdose of guaifenesin have been nausea and vomiting [L6100].Although adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been performed the Collaborative Perinatal Project monitored 197 mother-child pairs exposed to guaifenesin during the first trimester [L6100]. An increased occurrence of inguinal hernias was found in the neonates [L6100]. However congenital defects were not strongly associated with guaifenesin use during pregnancy in 2 large groups of mother-child pairs [L6100].Moreover guaifenesin is excreted in breast milk in small quantities [L6100]. Subsequently caution should be exercised by balancing the potential benefit of treatment against any possible risks [L6100].Additionally an LD<sub>50</sub> value of 1510 mg/kg (rat oral) has been reported for guaifenesin [MSDS].,COC1=CC=CC=C1OCC(O)CO
Quinapril,Quinapril is the ethyl ester prodrug of the non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinaprilat.[L8420L8423] It is used to treat hypertension and heart failure.[L8420L8423] ACE inhibitors are commonly used as a first line therapy in the treatment of hypertension along with thiazide diuretics or beta blockers.[A184844]Quinapril was granted FDA approval on 19 November 1991.[L8420] A combination tablet with [hydrochlorothiazide] was also approved on 28 December 1999.[L8423],-1,CCOC(=O)[C@H](CCC1=CC=CC=C1)N[C@@H](C)C(=O)N1CC2=CC=CC=C2C[C@H]1C(O)=O

It is also used as an antiparkinsonian agent to treat extrapyramidal reactions and for postherpetic neuralgia. The mechanisms of its effects in movement disorders are not well understood but probably reflect an increase in synthesis and release of dopamine with perhaps some inhibition of dopamine uptake.,-1,NC12CC3CC(CC(C3)C1)C2
Methylprednisolone,Methylprednisolone is a [prednisolone] derivative glucocorticoid with higher potency than [prednisone].[A188811] It was first described in the literature in the late 1950s.[A188811A188814]Methylprednisolone was granted FDA approval on 24 October 1957.[L10785] In the outbreak of COVID-19 low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy was successful in treating COVID-19-associated pneumonia in one patient with long-term immunosuppression.[A192813] The efficacy of methylprednisolone in novel coronavirus pneumonia is being investigated further in clinical trials.[L12666],The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is >4g/kg.[L10824] The intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> in mice is 2292mg/kg and in rats is 100mg/kg.[L10824]Data regarding acute overdoses of glucocorticoids are rare.[L10785L10788] Chronic high doses of glucocorticoids can lead to the development of cataract glaucoma hypertension water retention hyperlipidemia peptic ulcer pancreatitis myopathy osteoporosis mood changes psychosis dermal atrophy allergy acne hypertrichosis immune suppression decreased resistance to infection moon face hyperglycemia hypocalcemia hypophosphatemia metabolic acidosis growth suppression and secondary adrenal insufficiency.[A188405] Treat acute overdoses with symptomatic and supportive therapy while chronic overdoses will require temporarily reduced dosages.[A188405L10788],[H][C@@]12CC[C@](O)(C(=O)CO)[C@@]1(C)C[C@H](O)[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])C[C@H](C)C2=CC(=O)C=C[C@]12C
Methyldopa,Methyldopa or α-methyldopa is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent and an antihypertensive agent.[A231784] It is an analog of DOPA (34‐hydroxyphenylanine) and it is a prodrug meaning that the drug requires biotransformation to an active metabolite for therapeutic effects. Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(α)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals.[A1499] Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-α-methyldopa and L-α-methyldopa which is the active form.[A232224]First introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then methyldopa was largely replaced by newer better-tolerated antihypertensive agents;[A231784] however it is still used as monotherapy [L32614] or in combination with [hydrochlorothiazide].[L32619] Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.[L32624],The lowest published toxic dose via oral route is 44 gm/kg/3Y (intermittent) in a female. Oral LD<sub>50</sub> is 5000 mg/kg in rats and 5300 mg/kg in mice. Intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> is 300 mg/kg in rats and 150 mg/kg in mice.[L32704]Acute overdosage is characterized by acute hypotension and other presentations attributed to the brain and gastrointestinal dysfunction such as excessive sedation weakness bradycardia dizziness light-headedness constipation distention flatus diarrhea nausea and vomiting. Symptomatic and supportive measures should be initiated in the event of methyldopa overdose. Overdosage following recent oral ingestion can be managed by gastric lavage or emesis as well as infusions to limit further drug absorption. Cardiac rate and output blood volume electrolyte balance paralytic ileus urinary function and cerebral activity should be closely monitored. The use of sympathomimetic drugs such as levarterenol epinephrine and metaraminol bitartrate or dialysis may be considered.[L32614],C[C@](N)(CC1=CC=C(O)C(O)=C1)C(O)=O
Dactinomycin,A compound composed of a two cyclic peptides attached to a phenoxazine that is derived from streptomyces parvullus.

Isotretinoin,Isotretinoin is a retinoid derivative of vitamin A used in the treatment of severe recalcitrant acne.[Label] It was most widely marketed under the brand name Accutane which has since been discontinued.[L6574] Isotretinoin is associated with major risks in pregnancy and is therefore only available under the iPLEDGE program in the United States.[L6579] The first isotretinoin-containing product was FDA approved on 7 May 1982.[L6574],Patients experiencing an overdose may present with vomiting facial flushing cheilosis abdominal pain headache dizziness and ataxia.[Label] These symptoms may rapidly resolve.[Label] Generally no treatment is required for these overdoses.[A179113]The oral lowest dose causing toxic effect (TDLO) for children is 30mg/kg/21W oral TDLO for men is 24mg/kg/4W oral TDLO for women is 56mg/kg/8W.[L6592] The intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> for rats is 901mg/kg oral LD<sub>50</sub> for mice is 3389mg/kg oral LD<sub>50</sub> for rats is >4000mg/kg.[L6592]Isotretinoin is associated with major congenital malformations spontaneous abortion and premature birth.[Label] It is unknown if isotretinoin is expressed in breast milk but due to the associated hazards a decision should be made to either stop nursing or stop taking isotretinoin.[Label]In animal studies isotretinoin was associated with an increased risk of pheochromocytoma and adrenal medullary hyperplasia at doses above the recommended clinical dose.[Label] Isotretinoin was negative for the Ames test of mutagenicity once and weakly positive a second time.[Label] It has not been shown to be clastogenic.[Label] A study in dogs noted testicular atrophy after doses of 10-30 times the recommended clinical dose for 30 weeks.[Label] In trials with men there were no effects seen on sperm count motility morphology ejaculate volume and seminal plasma fructose.[Label],-1
Doxorubicin,Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with daunorubicin another cytotoxic agent in 1970.[A1575A257709A257614] Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the methyl group of daunorubicin.[A257709] Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species.[A257614] Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer including but not limited to breast lung gastric ovarian thyroid non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s lymphoma multiple myeloma sarcoma and pediatric cancers.[A1573A257614L45231] However one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.[A257719],Doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment can increase the risk of secondary malignancies based on postmarketing reports. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay and clastogenic in multiple in vitro assays (CHO cell V79 hamster cell human lymphoblast and SCE assays) and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.[L45231]Doxorubicin hydrochloride decreased fertility in female rats at doses of 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.005 and 0.02 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area).[L45231] In females of reproductive potential Doxorubicin hydrochloride may cause infertility and result in amenorrhea. Premature menopause can occur. Recovery of menses and ovulation is related to age at treatment.[L45231]A single intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg doxorubicin hydrochloride (approximately 0.01 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was toxic to male reproductive organs in animal studies producing testicular atrophy diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and oligospermia/hypospermia in rats. Doxorubicin hydrochloride induces DNA damage in rabbit spermatozoa and dominant lethal mutations in mice.[L45231]Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Injection/for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman; avoid the use of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Injection/for Injection during the 1st trimester. Available human data do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects and miscarriage related to the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits when administered during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.07 times (based on body surface area) the recommended human dose of 60 mg/m2. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.[L45231]Based on postmarketing reports pediatric patients treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride are at risk for developing late cardiovascular dysfunction. Risk factors include young age at treatment (especially < 5 years) high cumulative doses and receipt of combined modality therapy. Long-term periodic cardiovascular monitoring is recommended for all pediatric patients who have received doxorubicin hydrochloride. Doxorubicin hydrochloride as a component of intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to pediatric patients may contribute to prepubertal growth failure and may also contribute to gonadal impairment which is usuallytemporary.[L45231],COC1=CC=CC2=C1C(=O)C1=C(O)C3=C(C[C@](O)(C[C@@H]3O[C@H]3C[C@H](N)[C@H](O)[C@H](C)O3)C(=O)CO)C(O)=C1C2=O

Albuterol,Salbutamol (Albuterol [USAN]) is a short-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.[LabelA174379A174400],The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of albuterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g. seizures angina hypertension or hypotension tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min arrhythmias nervousness headache tremor muscle cramps dry mouth palpitation nausea dizziness fatigue malaise insomnia hyperglycemia hypokalemia metabolic acidosis).[Label] In particular the signs of salbutamol overdosage are significant tachycardia and/or significant muscle tremor.[F3265F3268]Hypokalaemia may occur following overdosage with salbutamol.[F3265] Serum potassium levels should be monitored.[F3265]Lactic acidosis has been reported in association with high therapeutic doses as well as overdoses of short-acting beta-agonist therapy therefore monitoring for elevated serum lactate and consequent metabolic acidosis (particularly if there is persistence or worsening of tachypnea despite resolution of other signs of bronchospasm such as wheezing) may be indicated in the setting of overdose.[F3265F3268]Salbutamol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.[Label] There are no adequate and well-controlled trials with salbutamolc or albuterol sulfate in pregnant women.[Label] During worldwide marketing experience various congenital anomalies including cleft palate and limb defects have been reported in the offspring of patients being treated with salbutamol.[Label] Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies.[Label] No consistent pattern of defects can be discerned and a relationship between salbutamol use and congenital anomalies has not been established.[Label] Animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits revealed evidence of teratogenicity.[Label] Salbutamol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetusLabel]. Women should be advised to contact their physicians if they become pregnant while taking salbutamol.[Label]Since there exists a potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility the use of salbutamol during labour should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.[Label]Plasma levels of albuterol sulfate and HFA-134a after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low in humans but it is not known whether the components of salbutamol are excreted in human milk.[Label] Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in animal studies and lack of experience with the use of salbutamol by nursing mothers a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.[Label] Caution should be exercised when salbutamol is administered to a nursing woman.[Label] The safety and effectiveness of salbutamol in children younger than 4 years of age has not yet been established.[Label]Clinical trials of VENTOLIN HFA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether older subjects respond differently than younger subjects.[Label] Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.[Label] In general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.[Label] The LD<sub>50</sub> value was determined to be 1100 mg/kg (orally in mice).,CC(C)(C)NCC(O)C1=CC(CO)=C(O)C=C1
Abacavir,Abacavir (ABC) is a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used to treat HIV and AIDS. Chemically it is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside and is the enantiomer with 1S 4R absolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. In vivo abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base abacavir.,Some myocardial degeneration has been noticed in rats and mice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (incidence ≥10%) in adult HIV-1 clinical trials were nausea headache malaise and fatigue nausea and vomiting and dreams/sleep disorders. Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir which has been strongly linked to the presence of the HLA-B*57:01 allele. This reaction manifests itself in patients within the first 6 weeks of treatment. Patients should be tested for the presence of this allele as recommended by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ,NC1=NC2=C(N=CN2[C@@H]2C[C@H](CO)C=C2)C(NC2CC2)=N1
Ibuprofen,Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics.[A39074] The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin.[A39075] Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]On the available products ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194],The symptoms of overdose are presented in individuals that consumed more than 99 mg/kg. Most common symptoms of overdose are abdominal pain nausea vomiting lethargy vertigo drowsiness (somnolence) dizziness and insomnia. Other symptoms of overdose include headache loss of consciousness tinnitus CNS depression convulsions and seizures. May rarely cause metabolic acidosis abnormal hepatic function hyperkalemia renal failure dyspnea respiratory depression coma acute renal failure and apnea (primarily in very young pediatric patients).[A39200]The reported LD50 of ibuprofen is of 636 mg/kg in rat 740 mg/kg in mouse and 495 mg/kg in guinea pig.[MSDS],CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(O)=O
Diphenhydramine,"Diphenhydramine - perhaps known most commonly as its brand name formulation Benadryl - is a first-generation H1 receptor antihistamine that is used extensively for the treatment of seasonal allergies insect bites and stings and rashes [L5263 L5266 L5269 F3379]. However it also has antiemetic antitussive hypnotic and antiparkinson properties [L5269 F3352]. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system [L5263 L5266 L5269 F3379 A174541]. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for ""night time"" use [L5263 L5281 L5287]. Diphenhydramine is also used in combination with [DB14132] as the anti-nausea drug [DB00985] where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system [A1540].Diphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine norepinephrine serotonin acetylcholine and opioid [A1539]. As a result diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties.",Overdose is expected to result in effects similar to the adverse effects that are ordinarily associated with the use of diphenhydramine including drowsiness hyperpyrexia and anticholinergic effects among others [L5266 L5269 L5281 L5287 F3394]. Additional symptoms during overdose may include mydriasis fever flushing agitation tremor dystonic reactions hallucinations and ECG changes [L5287]. Large overdose may cause rhabdomyolysis convulsions delirium toxic psychosis arrhythmias coma and cardiovascular collapse [L5287]. Moreover with higher doses and particularly in children symptoms of CNS excitation including hallucinations and convulsions may appear; with massive doses coma or cardiovascular collapse may follow [F3394].Although diphenhydramine has been in widespread use for many years without ill consequence it is known to cross the placenta and has been detected in breast milk [F3394]. This medication should therefore only be used when the potential benefit of treatment to the mother exceeds any possible hazards to the developing fetus or suckling infant [F3394].Pharmacokinetic studies indicate no major differences in the distribution or elimination of diphenhydramine compared to younger adults [F3394]. Nevertheless diphenhydramine should be used with caution in the elderly who are more likely to experience adverse effects [L5287]. Avoid use in elderly patients with confusion [L5287].The results of a review on the use of diphenhydramine in renal failure suggest that in moderate to severe renal failure the dose interval should be extended by a period dependent on Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [F3394].After intravenous administration of 0.8 mg/kg diphenhydramine a prolonged half-life was noted in patients with chronic liver disease which correlated with the severity of the disease [F3394]. However the mean plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not significantly affected [F3394].LD<sub>50</sub>=500 mg/kg (orally in rats). Considerable overdosage can lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack) serious ventricular dysrhythmias coma and death.,CN(C)CCOC(C1=CC=CC=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1
Chlorpheniramine,A histamine H1 antagonist used in allergic reactions hay fever rhinitis urticaria and asthma. It has also been used in veterinary applications. One of the most widely used of the classical antihistaminics it generally causes less drowsiness and sedation than promethazine.,Oral LD50 (rat): 306 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (mice): 130 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (guinea pig): 198 mg/kg [Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances.

Nifedipine,Nifedipine or BAY a 1040 is a first generation dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker similar to [nicardipine].[A190210A190273A175390L11383] Nifedipine was developed by Bayer and first described in the literature along with other dihydropyridines in 1972.[A175390A190276] Since nifedipine's development second and third generation dihydropyridines have been developed with slower onsets and longer durations of action.[A190273] The most popular of the third generation dihydropyridines is [amlodipine].[A190273]Nifedipine was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1981.[L11383],The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 1022mg/kg and in mice is 202mg/kg.[L11428]Patients experiencing an overdose may present with hypotension sinus node dysfunction atrioventricular node dysfunction and reflex tachycardia.[A190219A190222] Overdose may be managed by monitoring cardiovascular and respiratory function; elevating extremities; and administering vasopressors fluids and calcium infusions.[L11383],COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(C)=C(C1C1=CC=CC=C1[N+]([O-])=O)C(=O)OC
Rabeprazole,Rabeprazole is an antiulcer drug in the class of proton pump inhibitors. It is a prodrug - in the acid environment of the parietal cells it turns into active sulphenamide form.

Pioglitazone,Pioglitazone is an antihyperglycemic used as an adjunct to diet exercise and other antidiabetic medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11416L11419L11422L11425] It is administered as a racemic mixture though there is no pharmacologic difference between the enantiomers and they appear to interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence.[L11416] The thiazolidinedione class of medications which also includes [rosiglitazone] and [troglitazone] exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose[L11416] via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).[A19757] PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the expression of more than 100 genes and affect numerous metabolic processes most notably lipid and glucose homeostasis.[A19759]Thiazolidinediones including pioglitazone have fallen out of favor in recent years due to the presence of multiple adverse effects and warnings regarding their use (e.g. congestive heart failure bladder cancer) and the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11461],The oral TDLo observed in mice is 24 mg/kg for 4 days and for rats is 3 mg/kg for 6 days.[L11431]One instance of overdose was reported during clinical trials with pioglitazone in which a patient took an oral dose of 120mg daily for four days followed by 180mg daily for seven days[L11416] - this patient did not report any adverse clinical symptoms during this time.

Budesonide,Budesonide is a glucocorticoid that is a mix of the 22R and 22S epimer used to treat inflammatory conditions of the lungs and intestines such as asthma COPD Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.[A188529A188532]Budesonide was granted FDA approval on 14 February 1994.[L10598] It is also available in a combination product with [formoterol].[L10619],Acute overdose of corticosteroids is rare however prolonged high dosing of corticosteroids can lead to hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression.[L10601L10604L10607L10613L10619L10622L10625] In the case of overdose reduce the dosage of corticosteroids temporarily.[L10601L10604L10607L10613L10619L10622L10625]A 200mg oral dose is lethal to female mice while a 400mg oral dose is lethal to male mice.[L10601L10604L10622],[H][C@@]12C[C@H]3OC(CCC)O[C@@]3(C(=O)CO)[C@@]1(C)C[C@H](O)[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)C=C[C@]12C
Aripiprazole,Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic orally indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia bipolar I major depressive disorder irritability associated with autism and Tourette's.[L45859] It is also indicated as an injection for agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania.[L45859] Aripiprazole exerts its effects through agonism of dopaminergic and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors.[L45859A4393] Aripiprazole was given FDA approval on November 15 2002.[L6136],Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs including ABILIFY during the third trimester of  pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia bipolar I disorder or major depressive disorder and with exposure to antipsychotics including ABILIFY during pregnancy.[L45859] In animal reproduction studies oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during organogenesis in rats and/or rabbits at doses 10 and 19 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area produced fetal death decreased fetal weight undescended testicles delayed skeletal ossification skeletal abnormalities and diaphragmatic hernia. Oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during the pre- and post-natal period in rats at doses 10 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area produced prolonged gestation stillbirths decreased pup weight and decreased pup survival.[L45859]  ABILIFY has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse tolerance or physical dependence. Consequently patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ABILIFY misuse or abuse (e.g. development of tolerance increases in dose drug-seeking behavior).[L45859]In physical dependence studies in monkeys withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused diverted and/or abused once marketed.[L45859] In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral ABILIFY have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral ABILIFY alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported with ABILIFY alone. The largest known dose with a known outcome involved acute ingestion of 1260 mg of oral ABILIFY (42 times the maximum recommended daily dose) by a patient who fully recovered. Deliberate or accidental overdosage was also reported in children (age 12 years and younger) involving oral ABILIFY ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.[L45859]  Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with oral ABILIFY overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting somnolence and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with ABILIFY overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis aggression aspartate aminotransferase increased atrial fibrillation bradycardia coma confusional state convulsion blood creatine phosphokinase increased depressed level of consciousness hypertension hypokalemia hypotension lethargy loss of consciousness QRS complex prolonged QT prolonged pneumonia aspiration respiratory arrest status epilepticus and tachycardia.[L45859] No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with ABILIFY. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy maintaining an adequate airway oxygenation and ventilation and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.[L45859]  _Charcoal_: In the event of an overdose of ABILIFY an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of ABILIFY decreased the mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of aripiprazole by 50%.[L45859] _Hemodialysis_: Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with ABILIFY hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.[L45859]  Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice F344 rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1 3 10 and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1 3 and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2 0.5 2 and 5 times and 0.3 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area respectively). In addition SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10 20 40 and 60 mg/kg/day which are 3 6 13 and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area. Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or male rats. In female mice the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 5 times the MRHD). In female rats the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD).[L45859] An increase in mammary pituitary and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D2-receptor antagonism and hyperprolactinemia. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13 week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4 week and 13 week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear.[L45859]The mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reverse-mutation assay the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (23-DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite 23-DCPP increased numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice; however the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.[L45859] Female rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation Day 7 at doses of 2 6 and 20 mg/kg/day which are 0.6 2 and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 2 and 6 times the MRHD and decreased fetal weight was seen at 6 times the MRHD.[L45859] Male rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating at doses of 20 40 and 60 mg/kg/day which are 6 13 and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 19 times the MRHD and prostate atrophy was seen at 13 and 19 times the MRHD without impairment of fertility.[L45859] Pharmacokinetic properties in patients 10-17 years of age are similar to that of adults once body weight has been corrected for. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients however aripiprazole is not approved for Alzheimer's associated psychosis. Patients classified as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should be prescribed half the regular dose of aripiprazole. Hepatic and renal function as well as sex race and smoking status do not affect dosage requirements for aripiprazole [L45859A177904],ClC1=CC=CC(N2CCN(CCCCOC3=CC4=C(CCC(=O)N4)C=C3)CC2)=C1Cl
Dextroamphetamine,Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of amphetamine[A2505]. Dextroamphetamine was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[L6010L52145],Dextroamphetamine has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in mice at 41 times the maximum human dose.[L52145] These effects were not seen in rat or rabbit studies and the effects on human pregnancy have not been studied.[L52145] The risk and benefit of use during pregnancy should be weighed as bone deformities tracheoesophageal fistula anal atresia low birthweight and withdrawl have been reported in the children of mothers who were taking dextroamphetamine during pregnancy.[L52145] Mothers should not take amphetamines while nursing as the drug is excreted in breast milk.[L52145] Long term effects of dextroamphetamine have not bee determined in pediatric patients and dextroamphetamine should be avoided in children under 3 years.[L52145],C[C@H](N)CC1=CC=CC=C1
Everolimus,Everolimus is a derivative of Rapamycin (sirolimus) and works similarly to Rapamycin as an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor.

Flibanserin,Flibanserin is the first drug to be approved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women by the FDA in August 2015. It was originally developed as an antidepressant medication by Boehringer Ingelheim but showed lack of efficacy in trials and was further developed as a hypoactive sexual disorder drug by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. Flibanserin's mechanism of action is attributed to its high affinity for 5-HTA1 and 5-HTA2 receptors displaying agonist activity on 5-HTA1 and antagonist on 5-HTA2 resulting in lowering of serotonin in the brain as well as an effect on increasing norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters.,-1,FC(F)(F)C1=CC(=CC=C1)N1CCN(CCN2C(=O)NC3=CC=CC=C23)CC1
Abiraterone,Abiraterone is a potent irreversible and selective inhibitor of 17 αhydroxylase/C1720-lyase (CYP17) an enzyme expressed in testicular adrenal and prostatic tumour tissues to regulate androgen biosynthesis.[A3811 A260880 L40968] Abiraterone was first approved by the FDA and EMA on April[A260880] July[L47745] and September 2011[A260880] respectively. It is used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer hormone-sensitive high-risk metastatic prostate cancer. [L40968 L40193 L47740 L47745] and when used in combination with niraparib BRCA2-mutated metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).[L54773L54768]As abiraterone has poor oral bioavailability and is susceptible to hydrolysis by esterases abiraterone acetate was developed as an orally bioavailable prodrug with enhanced stability and absorption.[A3811 A260835],The oral LD<sub>50</sub> is > 400 mg/kg in rats and 800 mg/kg in mice.[L47730]The human experience of overdose with abiraterone is limited. Toxicity is related to the blockade of CYP17 activity. Blockade results in the accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids like 11-deoxycorticosterone leading to secondary hyperaldosteronism. Signs of hyperaldosteronism include fluid retention and hypokalemia.[A257158] As there is no specific antidote for abiraterone overdose overdosage should be managed with general supportive measures including monitoring and assessment of cardiac and liver function.[L40968 L40193],[H][C@@]12CC=C(C3=CC=CN=C3)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CC=C2C[C@@H](O)CC[C@]12C

Aflibercept,Aflibercept is a recombinant protein composed of the binding domains of two human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 fused with the Fc region of human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1).[A261130] Structurally Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 96.9 kilo Daltons (kDa).[A261276] It contains approximately 15% glycosylation to give a total molecular weight of 115 kDa.[L47915] All five putative N-glycosylation sites on each polypeptide chain predicted by the primary sequence can be occupied with carbohydrates and exhibit some degree of chain heterogeneity including heterogeneity in terminal sialic acid residues except at the single unsialylated site associated with the Fc domain.[A261281A261286] Due to the 2 fused VEGFR aflibercept has a higher affinity to the cognate ligands than the endogenous individual receptor. However it lacks the intracellular structure to propagate subsequent signal transduction thus essentially sequestering the ligands to prevent activation of VEGFR.[A261130L47915]Ziv-aflibercept under the brand name Zaltrap was developed as an intravenous injection for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and it was approved by the FDA and EMA in August 2012 and February 2013 respectively.[L47966L47971] The intravitreal formulation under the brand name EYELEA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants in February 2023 and for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in August 2023.[L47976] An aflibercept biosimilar Yesafili was approved for use in the EU in September 2023.[L50036]Three aflibercept biosimilars—Yesafili (aflibercept-jbvf)[L53043] and Opuviz (aflibercept-yszy)[L53038] approved in May 2024 and Ahzantive (aflibercept-mrbb)[L53048] approved in July 2024—were authorized by the FDA as treatments for retinal diseases; Enzeevi (aflibercept-abzv)[L53053] approved in August 2024 was also approved by the FDA for similar indications.,For all intravitreal VEGF inhibitors there is increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. An increase in intraocular pressure may also occur. When used intravenously most common adverse reactions were leukopenia diarrhea neutropenia proteinuria AST increased stomatitis fatigue thrombocytopenia ALT increased hypertension weight decreased decreased appetite epistaxis abdominal pain dysphonia serum creatinine increased and headache.[L47915]Adequate and well-controlled studies with aflibercept have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits including external visceral and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects systemic exposure (based on AUC for free aflibercept) was approximately 0.9 -fold of the population pharmacokinetic estimated exposure in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg.[L47915]Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response and it is not known whether EYLEA HD can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept treatment with aflibercept may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. Aflibercept should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.[L47915]Overdosing with increased injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore in case of overdosage intraocular pressure should be monitored and if deemed necessary by the treating physician adequate treatment should be initiated.[L47915]No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg. Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was 91 times higher than the population pharmacokinetic estimated systemic exposure in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg.[L47915],
Aclidinium,Aclidinium is an anticholinergic for the long-term management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has a much higher propensity to bind to muscarinic receptors than nicotinic receptors.

Albiglutide,Albiglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist (GLP-1) biologic drug indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is marketed under the brands Eperzan and Tanzeum by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline). It is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4-resistant glucagon-like peptide-1 dimer fused to human albumin. Albiglutide was approved on April 15 2014 by the FDA.,-RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS-Albiglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2). Routine serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound monitoring is of uncertain value in patients treated with Albiglutide. ,
Lixisenatide,Lixisenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is sold by Sanofi-Aventis under the brand name Adlyxin in the US[L763] and Lyxumia in the EU.[L764] Adlyxin recieved FDA approval July 28 2016.[L763],Thyroid C-cell adenomas occurred in rats when exposed to >15 times human exposure of 20mcg/day.[L48400] Overdose is associated with GI side effects typical of GLP-1 receptor agonists.,
Acalabrutinib,To date acalabrutinib has been used in trials studying the treatment of B-All myelofibrosis ovarian cancer multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma among others.As of October 31 2017 the FDA approved Astra Zeneca's orally administered Calquence (acalabrutinib capsules). This Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma and in adult patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have already received at least one prior therapy.[L10241] In August 2022 the FDA approved a new tablet formulation of Calquence enabling the co-administration of this drug with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).[L42795L42800] Unlike Calquence capsules the co-administration of Calquence tablets and PPIs does not have an effect in the pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib.[L10241L42795]Also known as ACP-196 acalabrutinib is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK.Nevertheless acalabrutinib was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway which is based upon overall response rate and faciliates earlier approval of medicines that treat serious conditions or/and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for acalabrutinib's currently accepted indication may subsequently be contingent upon ongoing verification and description of clinical benefit in confimatory trials.Furthermore the FDA granted this medication Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. It also received Orphan Drug designation which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. At this time more than 35 clinical trials across 40 countries with more than 2500 patients are underway or have been completed with regards to further research into better understanding and expanding the therapeutic uses of acalabrutinib [L1009].,Data regarding the toxicity of acalabrutinib is not readily available.[L10241],CC#CC(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C1=NC(=C2N1C=CN=C2N)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)NC1=CC=CC=N1
Rifamycin,Rifamycin is the prime member of the rifamycin family which are represented by drugs that are a product of fermentation from the gram-positive bacterium _Amycolatopsis mediterranei_ also known as _Streptomyces mediterranei_. The parent compound of rifamycin was rifamycin B which was originally obtained as a main product in the presence of diethylbarburitic acid. Some small modifications where performed in this inactive compound and with the creation of rifamycin SV there was the first antibiotic used intravenously for the treatment of tuberculosis.[A39990]Rifamycin has had several direct derivative products such as rifamycin SV rifaximin rifampin and rifamycin CV. All of the derivatives have slight different physicochemical properties when compared to the parent structure.[A39986]Rifamycin was further developed by Cosmo Technologies Ltd and approved in November 16 2018 by the FDA as a prescription drug after being granted the designation of Qualified Infectious Disease Product which allowed it to have a status a priority review.[L4800] This drug was also sent for review to the EMA in 2015 by Dr. Falk Pharma Gmbh and it was granted a waiver for the tested conditions.[L4801],-1,CO[C@H]1\C=C\O[C@@]2(C)OC3=C(C)C(O)=C4C(O)=C(NC(=O)\C(C)=C/C=C/[C@H](C)[C@H](O)[C@@H](C)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](C)[C@H](OC(C)=O)[C@@H]1C)C=C(O)C4=C3C2=O
Abemaciclib,Abemaciclib is an antitumor agent and dual inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 (CDK4) and 6 (CDK6) that are involved in the cell cycle and promotion of cancer cell growth in case of unregulated activity. On September 28 2017 FDA granted approval of abemaciclib treatment under the market name Verzenio for the treatment of HR-positive and HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after unsuccessful endocrine therapy. It is either given alone in patients who has undergone endocrine therapy and chemotherapy after the metastasis of cancer or in combination with [DB00947]. Following oral treatment in patients with HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer abemaciclib demonstrated increased progression-free survival rates and objective response rates. Abemaciclib has been used in trials studying the treatment of melanoma lymphoma neoplasm solid tumor and glioblastoma.,According to the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay abemaciclib and its active metbolites M2 and M20 did not display mutagenic properties. Abemaciclib was not clastogenic *in vitro* rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed to assess the effects of abemaciclib in testis epididymis prostate and seminal vesicle at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥0.3 mg/kg/day in dogs which exceed the recommeded therapeutic doses in humans. The findings included decreased organ weights intratubular cellular debris hypospermia tubular distillation atrophy and degeneration or necrosis [FDA Label]. ,CCN1CCN(CC2=CC=C(NC3=NC=C(F)C(=N3)C3=CC(F)=C4N=C(C)N(C(C)C)C4=C3)N=C2)CC1
Tralokinumab,Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disorder that causes skin inflammation skin barrier dysfunction and chronic pruritus.[A242432] It is estimated to affect up to 20% of adults and children worldwide and is frequently associated with other atopic conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis. While AD is a heterogenous condition with a variety of apparent genetic and environmental causes[A242422] it is primarily driven by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13).[A242427]Tralokinumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeted against IL-13. It neutralizes IL-13 activity by inhibiting its ability to bind with receptors thus helping to alleviate AD symptoms. Tralokinumab was first approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis by the EMA in June 2021 under the brand name Adtralza (Leo Pharma) and was subsequently approved in Canada in October 2021 and the US in December 2021.[L39287L39558],There are no data regarding overdosage with tralokinumab. In clinical trials intravenous doses up to 30 mg/kg and subcutaneous doses of 600mg every two weeks for 3 months were found to be well-tolerated.[L39282] In the event of a suspected overdose patients should be administered supportive care as clinically indicated.,
Trifarotene,"Trifarotene is a topical retinoid cream used in the treatment of acne vulgaris that was first approved for use in the United States in October 2019.[L9013] Retinoids are a class of medications structurally and functionally analogous to [vitamin A] though later generation retinoids such as trifarotene and [adapalene] bear little structural resemblance to vitamin A and are analogous only in function.[A187081] Trifarotene is considered the first of the ""fourth-generation"" retinoids due to its uniquely selective activity - this selectivity appears to confer improved efficacy and reduced side effects as compared to older less selective retinoids.[A187054]",Trifarotene does not appear to carry any risk of carcinogenesis when used at standard doses.[L9013] Systemic exposures in mice following both topical and oral administration were up to 1642 times higher than those seen in humans at the maximal recommended human dose and these systemic concentrations did not result in observed carcinogenicity.

Aceclidine,-1,Systemic toxicity following topical ocular administration of miotics like aceclidine is rare but patients who are sensitive may develop increased salivation sweating gastrointestinal overactivity and slowing of the pulse. Accidental oral ingestion can produce sweating salivation nausea tremors and slowing of the pulse and a decrease in blood pressure. In moderate overdosage spontaneous recovery is to be expected and may be aided by intravenous fluids to compensate for dehydration.[L53768],CC(=O)OC1CN2CCC1CC2
Erenumab,Erenumab (AMG-334) (INN; trade name Aimovig) is a human monoclonal antibody designed specifically to bind and antagonize the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRPR) as a means to prevent migraines. Aimovig as released and marketed by Novartis and Amgen is in fact a novel therapeutic approach as the first and only FDA approved treatment specifically developed to prevent migraine by blocking the CGRP receptor which is believed to play a critical role in migraine [L2823].In particular erenumab-aooe is a human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that has high affinity binding to the CGRP receptor [FDA Label]. The antibody is produced utlilizing recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells [FDA Label]. It is composed of 2 heavy chains each containing 456 amino acids and 2 light chains of the lambda subclass each containing 216 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa [FDA Label].,The most common side effects of erenumab include pain redness or swelling at the injection site and constipation. Information regarding overdosage is not available [FDA Label].,
Fremanezumab,Fremanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) for the prevention of migraine headaches.[L11749] It was developed by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and approved by the FDA in September 2018.[L11779] Along with other recently approved anti-CGRP therapies such as [galcanezumab] [erenumab] and the oral CGRP antagonist [ubrogepant] fremanezumab represents an important step forward in the treatment and prevention of migraine headaches.,Information regarding overdose of fremanezumab is not readily available. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation of fremanezumab therapy were injection site reactions including erythema induration and pain.[L11749],
Abrocitinib,Abrocitinib is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). Janus kinases are intracellular enzymes involved in transduction pathways that regulate hematopoiesis and immune cell function.[L39774] The Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis a chronic inflammatory skin disease with complex pathogenesis. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia skin barrier dysfunction and the aberrant activation of immune cells. Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis report reduced quality of life and often face limited treatment options. JAK inhibitors recently attracted more attention as potential treatments for inflammatory disorders as JAK inhibition is associated with rapid and sustained anti-inflammatory efects.[A244549]Abrocitinib was approved by the European Commission on December 10 2021 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.[L39784] On January 14 2022 the FDA approved abrocitinib for the treatment of refractory moderate-to-severe AD in adults whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products including biologics or when the use of those therapies is inadvisable.[L39779] Health Canada also approved the use of abrocitinib in pediatric patients 12 years and older.[L42395],There is no experience regarding human overdosage with abrocitinib.[L39769] In clinical trials there were no specific toxicities observed when abrocitinib was administered in single oral doses of 800 mg and 400 mg daily for 28 days. An overdose should be responded with symptomatic and supportive treatment as there is no specific antidote for overdose with abrocitinib.[L39774],CCCS(=O)(=O)N[C@H]1C[C@H](C1)N(C)C1=C2C=CNC2=NC=N1
Vamorolone,Vamorolone is a novel and fully synthetic glucocorticoid developed by Santhera Pharmaceuticals. It is used to manage inflammation and immune dysregulation in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) a neuromuscular disorder characterized by the insidious regression of neuromuscular function and the most common form of muscular dystrophy in the United States.[L48676] Corticosteroid therapy is the current standard of care for DMD despite relatively high rates of adverse effects.[L48676] Vamorolone is positioned as having a more tolerable adverse effect profile than other corticosteroids owing to its unique receptor binding profile[A261976] thus providing an additional treatment option in patients for whom corticosteroid adverse effects are intolerable or otherwise unacceptable.[L48676]Vamorolone was approved by the FDA in October 2023 for the management of DMD in patients ≥2 years of age.[L48671L48676] In December 2023 it was approved in the EU for the treatment of patients ≥4 years of age.[L49505],Specific data regarding vamorolone overdosage are not readily available. Prescribing information recommends supportive and symptomatic treatment in the event of suspected vamorolone overdose with consideration given to gastric lavage or emesis if clinically appropriate.[L48671],C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]4(C)C3=CC[C@]2(C)[C@@]1(O)C(=O)CO
Crizanlizumab,Crizanlizumab is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody used to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle cell disease.[L10097] Sickle cell disease is a genetically inherited condition prevalent in the Middle East Africa and certain parts of India. The genetic mutation associated with this disease leads to the formation of abnormal sickle shaped red blood cells that aggregate and block blood vessels throughout the body causing vaso-occlusive crises. Sickle cell disease can lead to excruciating pain stroke infection and various other complications arising from the blockage of blood vessels.[T734]Currently patients are prescribed [hydroxyurea] to raise levels of fetal hemoglobin as a method of reducing morbidity and mortality.[A187904] Though hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises adherence to this therapy is difficult due to adverse effects and the high variability of response to the drug between patients.[A187907] Crizanlizumab or SEG101 is given once every 4 weeks and may improve patient adherence. It was developed by Novartis and was granted FDA approval on November 15 2019.[L10097] While crizanlizumab received conditional marketing authorization from the EMA in October 2020 this approval was revoked in August 2023 due to concerns over the efficacy and safety of the drug.[L47750],Data regarding the toxicity of crizanlizumab is not readily available.[L10097],
Adagrasib,Adagrasib (MRTX849) is an oral small-molecule KRAS inhibitor developed by Mirati Therapeutics. KRAS mutations are highly common in cancer and account for approximately 85% of all RAS family mutations.[A254941] However the development of KRAS inhibitors has been challenging due to their high affinity for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) as well as the lack of a clear binding pocket.[A187559] Adagrasib targets KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> one of the most common KRAS mutations at the cysteine 12 residue and inhibits KRAS-dependent signalling.[A254052] In a phase I/IB clinical study that included patients with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-mutated advanced solid tumors (NCT03785249) adagrasib exhibited anti-tumor activity. The phase II of the same study showed that in patients with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adagrasib was efficient without new safety signals.[A254052A254057A254946]In February 2022 the FDA accepted a new drug application (NDA) for adagrasib for the treatment of patients with previously treated KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>–positive NSCLC.[L43847] In December 2022 the FDA granted accelerated approval to adagrasib for the treatment of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.[L44361L44366] Adagrasib joins [sotorasib] as another KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor approved by the FDA.[A254062],Toxicity information regarding adagrasib is not readily available. Patients experiencing an overdose are at an increased risk of severe adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity gastrointestinal adverse reactions and QTc interval prolongation.[L44361] Symptomatic and supportive measures are recommended. The carcinogenicity of adagrasib has not been evaluated. In an _in vitro_ bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay adagrasib was not mutagenic. An _in vitro_ chromosomal aberration assay and an _in vivo_ micronucleus assay in rats showed that it was not genotoxic. Studies evaluating the effects of adagrasib on fertility have not been performed. The oral administration of adagrasib to rats for up to 13 weeks induced phospholipidosis at doses higher than 150 mg/kg (approximately 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC). The presence of phospholipidosis led to the increased vacuolation of multiple organs.[L44361],[H][C@@]1(COC2=NC3=C(CCN(C3)C3=CC=CC4=C3C(Cl)=CC=C4)C(=N2)N2CCN(C(=O)C(F)=C)[C@@]([H])(CC#N)C2)CCCN1C
Nadofaragene firadenovec,Nadofaragene firadenovec (nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg) is a recombinant non-replicating adenovirus serotype 5 vector containing a transgene encoding human interferon alfa-2b (IFNα2b).[L44381] It was approved by the FDA on December 2022 for the treatment of high-risk Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma _in situ_ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors. It is the first gene therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of bladder cancer.[L44381L44431]BCG-unresponsive NMIBC has a high recurrence and is notably difficult to treat. Most patients with this condition undergo radical cystectomy since other non-surgical treatments are far less effective. The use of nadofaragene firadenovec provides a therapeutic alternative to patients seeking non-surgical alternatives for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.[A255111] Nadofaragene firadenovec is formulated with an excipient (Syn-3) that facilitates gene transfer across the urothelium and promotes the transduction of IFNα2b. The localized expression of this gene induces anti-tumor effects.[A255106L44381] Nadofaragene firadenovec also has a manageable adverse event profile. Compared to [pembrolizumab] a smaller proportion of patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events (4% vs 12.7%).[A255111],Toxicity information regarding nadofaragene firadenovec is not readily available. Patients experiencing an overdose are at an increased risk of severe adverse effects such as disseminated adenovirus infection.[L44381] Symptomatic and supportive measures are recommended. The carcinogenic mutagenic and fertility effects of nadofaragene firadenovec have not been evaluated.[L44381] Cynomolgus monkeys given 2.5 x 10<sup>11</sup> or 1.25 x 10<sub>13</sub> viral particles of nadofaragene firadenovec 90 days apart (1 x 10<sup>11</sup> or 5x10<sup>11 </sup>viral particles/mL) experienced inflammation urothelial hyperplasia cytoplasmic vacuolation and focal/multifocal ulceration in the urinary bladder and irritation in the ureter and urethra at necropsy 7 days after the first and second doses. These findings were resolved following the 57-day recovery period after the second administration. At this point a limited number of monkeys had minimal fibrosis in the lamina propria of the bladder.[L44381],
Acoramidis,Acoramidis is a small molecule stabilizer of transthyretin (TTR) for use in patients with TTR amyloidosis.[L51958] Similar to the previously developed [tafamidis] acoramidis is used to stabilize TTR in its tetrameric form preventing the formation of amyloidogenic monomers and the progression of amyloidosis.[A264768] Although they share a mechanism of action acoramidis is more selective for TTR and is a more potent stabilizer when compared to tafamidis.[A264768]Acoramidis has been in development since at least 2013.[A264808] It was brought to market by BridgeBio Pharma and approved by the FDA in November 2024 to reduce negative cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiomyopathy caused by TTR amyloidosis.[L51958L51968],According to prescribing information there are no data regarding overdosage with acoramidis.[L51958] In the event of a suspected overdose employ symptomatic and supportive measures as clinically indicated.,CC1=C(CCCOC2=CC(=CC=C2F)C(O)=O)C(C)=NN1
